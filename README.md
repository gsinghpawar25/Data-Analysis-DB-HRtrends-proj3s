##### Hiring and Termination Trends –
Yearly tracking of workforce additions and exits. Seasonal trends indicate peak hiring periods, while spikes in terminations may coincide with company restructuring or economic downturns.

Understanding workforce structure and job title distributions. Some departments experience higher turnover rates than others, potentially indicating job dissatisfaction or growth constraints within specific roles.
